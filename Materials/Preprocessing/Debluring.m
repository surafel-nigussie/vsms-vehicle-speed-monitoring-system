%% Deblurring Images Using the Blind Deconvolution Algorithm 
% This example shows how to use blind deconvolution to deblur images.
% The blind deconvolution algorithm can be used effectively when no
% information about the distortion (blurring and noise) is known. The
% algorithm restores the image and the point-spread function (PSF)
% simultaneously. The accelerated, damped Richardson-Lucy algorithm is used
% in each iteration. Additional optical system (e.g. camera)
% characteristics can be used as input parameters that could help to
% improve the quality of the image restoration. PSF constraints can be
% passed in through a user-specified function

%% Step 1: Read Image
% The example reads in an intensity image. The |deconvblind| function can
% handle arrays of any dimension.

I = imread('car-plate (3).jpg');
figure;imshow(I);title('Original Image');
text(size(I,2),size(I,1)+15, ...
    'Image courtesy of Massachusetts Institute of Technology', ...
    'FontSize',7,'HorizontalAlignment','right');

%% Step 2: Simulate a Blur 
% Simulate a real-life image that could be blurred (e.g., due to camera
% motion or lack of focus). The example simulates the blur by convolving a
% Gaussian filter with the true image (using |imfilter|). The Gaussian filter
% then represents a point-spread function, |PSF|.

PSF = fspecial('gaussian',7,10);
Blurred = imfilter(I,PSF,'symmetric','conv');
figure;imshow(Blurred);title('Blurred Image');

%% Step 3: Restore the Blurred Image Using PSFs of Various Sizes 
% To illustrate the importance of knowing the size of the true PSF, this
% example performs three restorations. Each time the PSF reconstruction
% starts from a uniform array--an array of ones.

%%
% The first restoration, |J1| and |P1|, uses an undersized array, |UNDERPSF|, for
% an initial guess of the PSF. The size of the UNDERPSF array is 4 pixels
% shorter in each dimension than the true PSF. 

UNDERPSF = ones(size(PSF)-4);
[J1, P1] = deconvblind(Blurred,UNDERPSF);
figure;imshow(J1);title('Deblurring with Undersized PSF');

%%
% The second restoration, |J2| and |P2|, uses an array of ones, |OVERPSF|, for an
% initial PSF that is 4 pixels longer in each dimension than the true PSF.

OVERPSF = padarray(UNDERPSF,[4 4],'replicate','both');
[J2, P2] = deconvblind(Blurred,OVERPSF);
figure;imshow(J2);title('Deblurring with Oversized PSF');

%%
% The third restoration, |J3| and |P3|, uses an array of ones, |INITPSF|, for an
% initial PSF that is exactly of the same size as the true PSF.

INITPSF = padarray(UNDERPSF,[2 2],'replicate','both');
[J3, P3] = deconvblind(Blurred,INITPSF);
figure;imshow(J3);title('Deblurring with INITPSF');

%% Step 4: Analyzing the Restored PSF
% All three restorations also produce a PSF. The following pictures show
% how the analysis of the reconstructed PSF might help in guessing the
% right size for the initial PSF. In the true PSF, a Gaussian filter, the
% maximum values are at the center (white) and diminish at the borders (black).

figure;
subplot(221);imshow(PSF,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
title('True PSF');
subplot(222);imshow(P1,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
title('Reconstructed Undersized PSF');
subplot(223);imshow(P2,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
title('Reconstructed Oversized PSF');
subplot(224);imshow(P3,[],'InitialMagnification','fit');
title('Reconstructed true PSF');

%% 
% The PSF reconstructed in the first restoration, |P1|, obviously does not
% fit into the constrained size. It has a strong signal variation at the
% borders. The corresponding image, |J1|, does not show any improved clarity
% vs. the blurred image, |Blurred|.

%%
% The PSF reconstructed in the second restoration, |P2|, becomes very smooth
% at the edges. This implies that the restoration can handle a PSF of a
% smaller size. The corresponding image, |J2|, shows some deblurring but it
% is strongly corrupted by the ringing.

%%
% Finally, the PSF reconstructed in the third restoration, |P3|, is somewhat
% intermediate between |P1| and |P2|. The array, |P3|, resembles the true PSF
% very well. The corresponding image, |J3|, shows significant improvement;
% however it is still corrupted by the ringing.

%% Step 5: Improving the Restoration
% The ringing in the restored image, |J3|, occurs along the areas of sharp
% intensity contrast in the image and along the image borders. This example
% shows how to reduce the ringing effect by specifying a weighting
% function. The algorithm weights each pixel according to the |WEIGHT| array
% while restoring the image and the PSF. In our example, we start by
% finding the "sharp" pixels using the edge function. By trial and error,
% we determine that a desirable threshold level is 0.3.

WEIGHT = edge(I,'sobel',.3);

%%
% To widen the area, we use |imdilate| and pass in a structuring element, |se|.

se = strel('disk',2);
WEIGHT = 1-double(imdilate(WEIGHT,se));

%%
% The pixels close to the borders are also assigned the value 0.

WEIGHT([1:3 end-(0:2)],:) = 0;
WEIGHT(:,[1:3 end-(0:2)]) = 0;
figure;imshow(WEIGHT);title('Weight array');

%%
% The image is restored by calling deconvblind with the |WEIGHT| array and an
% increased number of iterations (30). Almost all the ringing is suppressed.

[J, P] = deconvblind(Blurred,INITPSF,30,[],WEIGHT);
figure;imshow(J);title('Deblurred Image');

%% Step 6: Using Additional Constraints on the PSF Restoration
% The example shows how you can specify additional constraints on the PSF.
% The function, |FUN|, below returns a modified PSF array which deconvblind
% uses for the next iteration. 
%
% In this example, |FUN| modifies the PSF by cropping it by |P1| and |P2| number
% of pixels in each dimension, and then padding the array back to its
% original size with zeros. This operation does not change the values in
% the center of the PSF, but effectively reduces the PSF size by |2*P1| and
% |2*P2| pixels. 

P1 = 2;
P2 = 2;
FUN = @(PSF) padarray(PSF(P1+1:end-P1,P2+1:end-P2),[P1 P2]);

%%
% The anonymous function, |FUN|, is passed into |deconvblind| last. See the
% section Parameterizing Functions, in the MATLAB Mathematics
% documentation, for information about providing additional parameters to
% the function |FUN|.

%%
% In this example, the size of the initial PSF, |OVERPSF|, is 4 pixels
% larger than the true PSF. Setting P1 = 2 and P2 = 2 as parameters in
% |FUN| effectively makes the valuable space in |OVERPSF| the same size as
% the true PSF. Therefore, the outcome, |JF| and |PF|, is similar to the
% result of deconvolution with the right sized PSF and no |FUN| call, |J|
% and |P|, from step 4.

[JF, PF] = deconvblind(Blurred,OVERPSF,30,[],WEIGHT,FUN);
figure;imshow(JF);title('Deblurred Image');

%%
% If we had used the oversized initial PSF, |OVERPSF|, without the
% constraining function, |FUN|, the resulting image would be similar to the
% unsatisfactory result, |J2|, achieved in Step 3.
%
% Note, that any unspecified parameters before |FUN| can be omitted, such as
% |DAMPAR| and |READOUT| in this example, without requiring a place holder,
% ([]).
