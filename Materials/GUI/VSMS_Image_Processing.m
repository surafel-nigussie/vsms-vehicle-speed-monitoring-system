function varargout = VSMS_Image_Processing(varargin)
% VSMS_Image_Processing MATLAB code for VSMS_Image_Processing.fig
%      VSMS_Image_Processing, by itself, creates a new VSMS_Image_Processing or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = VSMS_Image_Processing returns the handle to a new VSMS_Image_Processing or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      VSMS_Image_Processing('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in VSMS_Image_Processing.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      VSMS_Image_Processing('Property','Value',...) creates a new VSMS_Image_Processing or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before VSMS_Image_Processing_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to VSMS_Image_Processing_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
